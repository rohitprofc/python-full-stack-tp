# MongoDB Notes

## 1. What is MongoDB and Where We Use It

### What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses a flexible, JSON-like document structure, making it easy to store and query data.

### Where We Use MongoDB?
- **Web Applications:** Due to its flexibility and scalability, MongoDB is widely used in web development.
- **Big Data:** MongoDB is suitable for managing large volumes of unstructured data.
- **Content Management Systems:** MongoDB can handle varied data structures, which is ideal for content management.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** MongoDB supports high-speed data ingestion and complex querying, making it suitable for real-time analytics.
- **IoT:** MongoDB can manage the massive, unstructured data generated by IoT devices.

## 2. Installation Process in Windows

### Step 1: Download MongoDB
- Visit the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- Choose the appropriate version for Windows.
- Download the MSI file.

### Step 2: Install MongoDB
- Run the downloaded MSI file.
- Follow the installation wizard. Choose the "Complete" setup type.
- Install MongoDB as a Windows service. Select the default options unless specific changes are needed.

### Step 3: Configure MongoDB
- By default, MongoDB will store data in `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\data\db`.
- Create this directory if it doesnâ€™t exist:
  ```sh
  mkdir C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\data\db
  ```
- Ensure the directory has the necessary permissions.

### Step 4: Add MongoDB to the PATH
- Add the MongoDB binaries to the system PATH:
  ```sh
  setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin"
  ```

### Step 5: Start MongoDB
- Start the MongoDB server by running:
  ```sh
  mongod
  ```
- You can now interact with MongoDB using the `mongo` shell.

## 3. CRUD Operations

### Create
To insert a document into a collection:
```js
db.collection.insertOne({ "name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York" });
```

### Read
To find all documents in a collection:
```js
db.collection.find();
```
To find documents with a specific condition:
```js
db.collection.find({ "age": { $gt: 25 } });
```

### Update
To update a document:
```js
db.collection.updateOne(
   { "name": "John" },
   { $set: { "age": 31 } }
);
```
To update multiple documents:
```js
db.collection.updateMany(
   { "city": "New York" },
   { $set: { "city": "Los Angeles" } }
);
```

### Delete
To delete a document:
```js
db.collection.deleteOne({ "name": "John" });
```
To delete multiple documents:
```js
db.collection.deleteMany({ "city": "Los Angeles" });
```

## Conclusion
MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that is widely used in various applications due to its flexibility and scalability. By following the installation steps and understanding basic CRUD operations, you can effectively manage data using MongoDB.

# Flask

## Step 1: Install virtualenv

First, ensure you have `virtualenv` installed. You can install it using `pip` if it's not already installed.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a directory for your Flask project and navigate into it. Then, create a virtual environment inside this directory.

```bash
mkdir my_flask_app
cd my_flask_app
virtualenv venv
```

This will create a directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment.

## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command for your operating system:

### On Windows

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS and Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, your command prompt will change to show the name of the virtual environment.

## Step 4: Install Flask

With the virtual environment activated, install Flask using `pip`.

```bash
pip install Flask
```

## Step 5: Create a Simple Flask Application

Create a new file named `app.py` in your project directory and add the following code to set up a simple Flask application.

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Step 6: Run the Flask Application

With the virtual environment activated, run the Flask application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see your Flask app in action.

## Step 7: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on your Flask project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Additional Tips

- To install additional packages, ensure your virtual environment is activated and use `pip install <package_name>`.
- You can list installed packages with `pip freeze` and save them to a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This is useful for sharing your project dependencies.
- To install packages from a `requirements.txt` file, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
